Such a file is called a module; definitions from a module can be imported into other modules or into the main module. So, a python module is nothing but a package to encapsulate reusable code. Modules reside in a folder with a __init__.py file on it. Modules can contain functions but also classes. Modules are imported using the import keyword.\n",
